* I am currently working at Vector Institute and University of Guelph with Dr. Graham Taylor.
* My research goal is to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms that have the human-like ability to
continuously learn (continual/lifelong learning) and generalize well using minimal or no labeled data (self-
supervised learning) for applications in computer vision, in particular, medical imaging.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronics & Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](www.iitg.ac.in) and MASc degree from the [University of Waterloo(www.uwaterloo.ca)].
