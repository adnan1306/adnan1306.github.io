* I am a PhD student at Vector Institute and University of Calgary, supervised by Dr. Yani Ioannou and Dr. Rahul Krishnan.
* My research goal is to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms that have the human-like ability to
continuously learn (continual/lifelong learning) and generalize well using minimal or no labeled data (self-
supervised learning) for applications in computer vision, in particular, medical imaging. I'm also interested in understanding learning in neural networks using Neural Tangent Kernels. 
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronics & Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati and MASc degree from the University of Waterloo.
