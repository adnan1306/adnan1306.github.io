* I am a PhD student at the Vector Institute and the University of Calgary, supervised by [Dr. Yani Ioannou](https://yani.ai/) and [Dr. Rahul Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/).
* My research goal is to make large foundational models, such as LLMs, smaller and efficient. Currently, my work focuses on developing efficient training methods for Sparse Neural Networks. I am also interested in understanding the training dynamics of (Sparse) Neural Networks, weight/permutation symmetries of Deep Neural Networks, and their effect on optimization and developing a better understanding of the loss landscape. Previously, I worked on Neural Tangent Kernel to better understand Shorcut Learning in Neural Networks.
* My research is supported by NSERC, Borealis AI, Digital Research Alliance of Canada and Killiam Fellowship.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronics & Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati and a MASc degree from the University of Waterloo.
